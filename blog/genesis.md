title: Hello WOrld
section: blog
---

This is the first post for this blog. I have been blogging in defferent mediums
for years now, but I never had the chance to have my own private world. So, I
wont be collecting my old posts here but intstead I will be adding new posts in
the process making this my trye blog.

This whole website, together with this blog are generated by my own static
website generator [bobgo](). One of the reason I chose to use my own static site
generator  is I have been building tools and libraries that other people use,
and I have since negleted them. So in this personal space I will be writing
about the tools I built and maybe help others to get to use them in a better
way.

I have no particular agenda, so probably will talk about technology, life and
things I like.

So, welcome dear reader.

"hello, world"
